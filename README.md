## 🧠 About Me

I’m a research-driven data scientist with a Master’s degree in **Data Science** from Princess Sumaya University for Technology and a Bachelor’s in **Software Engineering** from Al-Hussein Bin Talal University, where I graduated **first in my class**.

My current focus is **AI for medical applications**, especially image segmentation using deep learning. I also love working with symbolic AI, rough set theory, and optimization problems.
